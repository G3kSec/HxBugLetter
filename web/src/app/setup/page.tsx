          posts it to Discord. No server, no hosting, no review queue — it
          commits directly.

          RSS gives a title and a summary, nothing more. There&rsquo;s no
          reliable way to know the real bug type or severity from that alone,
          so the bot guesses from keywords in the title and summary. It gets
          things wrong sometimes &mdash; a research post about CSS-driven data
          exfiltration could easily get misfiled near XSS by a careless
          pattern, for instance. Every auto-archived entry is marked with a
          comment at the top of its file, and fixing one is just editing the
          YAML and committing the correction. See{" "}

              Several of these feeds still expose posts from 2017&ndash;2023.
              A feed being new to the bot doesn&rsquo;t make its archive
              news, so old entries are skipped rather than added as a
              &ldquo;new read&rdquo;. This also stops a freshly added source
              from dumping years of history into the archive at once.

          There&rsquo;s no separate history file. Before writing anything, the

          wrote that entry or a human did. If a URL is already there, it&rsquo;s

        </p>
        <p className="mt-3 max-w-[62ch] text-ink-2">
          One consequence: a feed has to expose a real, distinct URL per
          entry for this to work. A couple of podcast hosts don&rsquo;t
          &mdash; every episode shares the same homepage link &mdash; and for
          those the bot skips the entire source rather than silently losing
          episodes to a false duplicate match.
